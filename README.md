## A creative coding template that's using macroquad for display

Includes some math, geometry utils. Sprite support and ppt file format support.

Inactive for now, please also check out ![sketchrs](https://github.com/kirinokirino/sketchrs), which doesn't use macroquad but delegates the rendering to ![imagesink](https://github.com/kirinokirino/imagesink)
