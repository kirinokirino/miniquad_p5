## A creative coding template that's using macroquad for display

Includes some math, geometry utils. Sprite support and ppt file format support.

Inactive for now, please also check out !(sketchrs)[https://github.com/kirinokirino/sketchrs], which doesn't use macroquad but delegates the rendering to !(imagesink)[https://github.com/kirinokirino/imagesink]
